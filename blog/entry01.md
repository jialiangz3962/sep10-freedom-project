# SEP 10 Freedom Project
##### by Jialiang Zhong
## Context
I am currently a sophomore at HSTAT in the Software Engineering Program. This year, the class is going to start something called the Freedom Project. The Freedom Project includes finding a topic of the student's choice and solving issues that involve the topic with technology. 
## Content
The purpose for me picking the topic of medicinal chemistry is because in my life, there is nothing that fascinates me more than how interesting chemistry is. Along with my love for chemistry, I've also adopted feelings of how medicine is amazing, how it can change lives just by taking a small pill. Diseases around the world requires cures, and most of the cures lay in the factors of medicine, which is why I chose medicinal chemistry. In my personal experiences, my grandpa has diabetes, which has made life a lot more complex for his old body. It pains me to see how fragile a human being is, which is why I want to research medicinal chemistry, hoping to proactively create something that could change the way diseases affect society.

My backup options if I did not choose medicinal chemistry is photography or fashion because I find dressing in certain styles amazing and cool.
