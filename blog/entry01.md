# SEP 10 Freedom Project
##### by Jialiang Zhong
## Context
I am currently a sophomore at HSTAT in the Software Engineering Program. This year, the class is going to start something called the Freedom Project. The Freedom Project includes finding a topic of the student's choice and solving issues that involve the topic with technology. 
## Content
The purpose for me picking the topic of medicinal chemistry is because in my life, there is nothing that fascinates me more than how interesting chemistry is. Along with my love for chemistry, I've also adopted feelings of how medicine is amazing, how it can change lives just by taking a small pill. Diseases around the world requires cures, and most of the cures lay in the factors of medicine, which is why I chose medicinal chemistry. In my personal experiences, my grandpa has diabetes, which has made life a lot more complex for his old body. It pains me to see how fragile a human being is, which is why I want to research medicinal chemistry, hoping to proactively create something that could change the way diseases affect society.

My backup options if I did not choose medicinal chemistry is photography or fashion because I find dressing in certain styles amazing and cool.

## Sources
This is the website that involved me researching [chemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/chemical-technology). The website is about different types of research in chemistry, and has useful information containing drug research aswell, which is what my topic is.

The other sources are about my latter topics, which is [photography](https://www.naturephotographers.network/articles/) and [fashion](https://www.voguebusiness.com/). The photography website contains the elements of what photograhy is, highlighting the fun components of photography which got me interested in the topic. The fashion website is a magazine, which I find intriguing and the reason why I brought up fashion in my topics of interest.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

Currently, I am on steps 1, 2, and 3 on the engineering design process. It is listed on the student's page that step 1 is to define the problem, which is the time consuming process of drug discovery along with the precision and accuracy for the properties of drugs. Step 2 is to research the problem, in which I have scavenged through websites in attempts to find the most frequent issues that associate medicinal chemistry with technology, which is the accuracy of the drug. On step 3, brainstorming solutions is to create a website that has details and processes that includes accuracy on drug predictions and possibly a solution to make other drugs for medicinal purposes.

## Skills 

The skills that have reflected upon me in this blog entry is the process in researching topics and how to work in increments instead of doing everything in one sitting. Over the days that this assignment was posted, I had been thinking about the process on how to work on this. On the first day, I had thought there wasn't much to worry about, but on the second day, I realized that researching topics were not as easy as I had thought. This led me to work on the skill of working in increments, as this assingment was due in later dates. Researching topics came easy, as all I had to do was go through articles about my topic and define the issue in which my topic is involved with technology. Overall, my skills in the fields of researching and learning how to work in increments of time had improved due to this assignment of my first blog entry.
