## Content
My thought process of going through Part B and thinking of an invention was through the motivation of the underlying issues found in my topic of Medicinal Chemistry. Currently, the technology that is used for analyzing molecular properties are not at top notch due to the expensive cost of the machine needed to make it and also the complexity associated with it. From the idea of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which is a scientific technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to study properties on atomic levels, I implemented that into the technology that I thought of, making the machine operate on a more precise and faster level. How I finalized my content was through following the format of the slides Mr. Mueller posted, with him demonstrating how it could be one thing with lots of bullet points, which I did, or many topics with seperated bullet points.
