## Content
My thought process of going through Part B and thinking of an invention was through the motivation of the underlying issues found in my topic of Medicinal Chemistry. Currently, the technology that is used for analyzing molecular properties are not at top notch due to the expensive cost of the machine needed to make it and also the complexity associated with it. From the idea of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which is a scientific technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to study properties on atomic levels, I implemented that into the technology that I thought of, making the machine operate on a more precise and faster level. How I finalized my content was through following the format of the slides Mr. Mueller posted, with him demonstrating how it could be one thing with lots of bullet points, which I did, or many topics with seperated bullet points. 

## Sources
The sources that I used is AI which helped me generate my image for the invention I was talking about. I also used the examples on slide 8 of 11/7, it was helpful and showed me what the expectations were. The links I used for the [AI](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img) and the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mp-55JWOPoUJVyf1_vTl6GTNLHABRuFsW5lOG5_AHMA/edit?slide=id.g3910d4b6a8d_0_0#slide=id.g3910d4b6a8d_0_0) are shown here.

## Engineering Design Process
Currently, I am on step four of my engineering design process, as I am thinking of the most efficient way to reciprocrate an efficient and precise way to build my design of a machine that is an analyzer used for medicinal chemistry. The steps that I took for planning the technology is considering what problems society has in the field and also how to fix this problem. Currently, I am still in the midst of researching for how I could improve what I have thought of, taking consideration of classmate feedback on the google classroom question. For the next step of the engineering design process, creating a prototype, I am thinking of how I should implement this into a website, as it is super complex and time consuming. What I am thinking of currently is a website where you could play around with certain elements and pick certain ones to examine in order to get information out of them.

## Skills
Things that I have learned since writing this blog is to always consider feedback on my ways of thinking along with prioritizing a task before something else. For example on google classroom, when my classmates told me that if it would be expensive and what materials I would use, would it be heavy, how would you use it. I learned how to improve upon what was there before, just like how a scooter goes to a bike, a motorbike, then a car. You can just make it, bad or good, you can always improve it later. How I proioritized my work is that I saw that I had a deltamath due on the day after the blog entry. The blog was worth more than my deltamath, so I just focused on my blog first and improved upon prioritizing tasks.
