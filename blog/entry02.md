## The Research I've Done (Content)
For my topic of medicinal chemistry, the approaches to fully understanding the topic is difficult as in websites there are many dictations of chemical symbols and tools that I am not familiar with. Using tools like the ctrl + f command in google, I've gotten valuable information from many different websites like [this](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-useful-mobile-apps-drug-discovery-professionals-andrii-buvailo), and [this](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Physical_Methods_in_Chemistry_and_Nano_Science_(Barron)/04%3A_Chemical_Speciation/4.07%3A_NMR_Spectroscopy). These websites contain the hardware and apps that I have researched on the topic of medicinal chemistry, demonstrating existing technology including apps like PolyPharma, which is an educational app, providing modeling tools. A hardware that I researched into is the Nuclear Magnetic Resnonance (NMR), where the hardware analyzes nuclear structures and determines what properties it contain. I found these tools online due to googling hardware and I looked into things that I wasn't familiar with, like PolyPharma and the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. From also watching youtube videos, I have learned that many people outside of this field of research are not acquainted with the tools of medicinal chemistry, so I took this into consideration and picked a hardware to demonstrate for my blog.
