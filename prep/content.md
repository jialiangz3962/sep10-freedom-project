Topic: **Medicinal Chemistry**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Medicianl Chemistry is the focus of the development and synthesis of medication through principles of chemistry. Medicinal Chemistry mainly focuses on drug discovery and development through modifying chemical compounds, with the goal of ultimately improving human health through safe and proper medication.
* Activties that involve medicinal chemistry are synthesizing new compounds and molecules, optimizing the drug synthesized for safe use, experimenting with the drug to analyze structure and purity.

## Part A: existing technology
* 1st google search: "apps of medicinal chemistry"
* 1st website looked into: "[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-useful-mobile-apps-drug-discovery-professionals-andrii-buvailo](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-useful-mobile-apps-drug-discovery-professionals-andrii-buvailo)"
  * The first app I reviewed was [PolyPharma](https://polypharma-ios.soft112.com/)
  * This app provides a good modeling tool with intuitive visualization layout for drug design practitioners
  * PolyPharma does not require an internet connection, easily accessible.
  * The app features powerful graphical module able to generate colour-coded heatmaps, and structure overlays for correlating structure regions with activity or inertness.
  * Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch and requires iOS 9.2 or later.
