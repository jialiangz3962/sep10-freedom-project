Topic: **Medicinal Chemistry**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Medicianl Chemistry is the focus of the development and synthesis of medication through principles of chemistry. Medicinal Chemistry mainly focuses on drug discovery and development through modifying chemical compounds, with the goal of ultimately improving human health through safe and proper medication.
* Activties that involve medicinal chemistry are synthesizing new compounds and molecules, optimizing the drug synthesized for safe use, experimenting with the drug to analyze structure and purity.

## Part A: existing technology
* 1st google search: "apps of medicinal chemistry"
* 1st website looked into: "[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-useful-mobile-apps-drug-discovery-professionals-andrii-buvailo](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-useful-mobile-apps-drug-discovery-professionals-andrii-buvailo)"
  * The first app I reviewed was [PolyPharma](https://polypharma-ios.soft112.com/)
  * This app provides a good modeling tool with intuitive visualization layout for drug design practitioners
  * PolyPharma does not require an internet connection, easily accessible.
  * The app features powerful graphical module able to generate colour-coded heatmaps, and structure overlays for correlating structure regions with activity or inertness.
  * Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch and requires iOS 9.2 or later.

* The second app I reviewed was **_ReactionFlash_**
  * This free app is a suitable way to spend time during travel or waiting in a queue refreshing memory on named chemical reactions and their mechanisms.
  * It is an educational app about medicinal chemistry
  * It can be used as a learning tool and a reference.
  * The app is available on Android, iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, it requires iOS 8.0 or later.

## Part B: possible future technology
* Medicinal chemistry in the future can be further driven by tools such as artifical intelligence.
  * Automations for medicinal chemistry leads to a higher output of discovery, more accurate structure predictions, along with identifying the type of drug easier. These automations in medicinal chemistry provides a decrease in the increments of workload and also is more convinient.
